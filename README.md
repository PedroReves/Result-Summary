## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned with Kevin Powell, most of the css techniques, we used grid a lot more than flexbox, we used custom properties to fix certain issues in our code, and some semantic HTML.
